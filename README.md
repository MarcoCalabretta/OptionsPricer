# OptionsPricer
This program prices stock options for any stock ticker you input into it. It will download all of the stock's options off the internet, try to estimate a price for the option using the binomial option pricing model, and put all the underpriced options into a spreadsheet.
Also tickers.txt is an input file that you can use to download options for (almost) all the stocks in the S&P 500. Running with this file as input should take about 20 minutes.
